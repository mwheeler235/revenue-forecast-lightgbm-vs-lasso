# Coffee Sales Revenue Forecasting

Our goals are to understand the best granularity for modeling coffee revenue across coffee types. After performing EDA, we can predict weekly coffee sales revenue by coffee type using LightGBM and Lasso regression models.

## Features

- **Time series forecasting** of weekly coffee revenue by coffee type
- **Feature engineering** including lag features, rolling averages, and seasonal patterns
- **Model comparison** between LightGBM and Lasso regression
- **Cross-validation** with coffee-type grouping to prevent data leakage
- **Performance evaluation** across 8 different coffee types

## Key Results

| Model | Overall RÂ² | MAPE | Features Used |
|-------|------------|------|---------------|
| **Lasso** | 0.786 | 16.5% | 15/25 selected |
| LightGBM | 0.686 | 19.8% | 25 features |

## Models Evaluated

1. **Combined LightGBM**: Single model trained on all coffee types
2. **Separate LightGBM**: Individual models per coffee type  
3. **Lasso Regression**: Linear model with automatic feature selection

## Dependencies

- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn  
- lightgbm
- matplotlib
