    "## 🔧 Data Quality Fix Applied\n",
    "\n",
    "**Issue Identified**: The original weekly aggregation in `data_prep.ipynb` created duplicate rows due to inconsistent week boundary definitions:\n",
    "- `year_week` (using `strftime('%Y-W%U')`) and `week_start_date` (using `to_period('W')`) created different week boundaries\n",
    "- Result: 641 samples instead of expected ~448 (43% inflation)\n",
    "- Example: \"Latte on 2024-12-30\" appeared 3 times with cascading lag values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Cause**: Grouping by both `year_week` and `week_start_date` caused the same calendar week to be split into multiple groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix Applied**: \n",
    "- ✅ Modified aggregation to group ONLY by `['week_start_date', 'coffee_name']`\n",
    "- ✅ Created `year_week` AFTER aggregation for reference purposes only\n",
    "- ✅ Verified: 421 samples with zero duplicates (each week-coffee combination appears exactly once)\n",
    "- ✅ The 421 vs 448 difference is expected (not all coffee types sold every week)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact**: This fix eliminates artificial temporal sequences and data leakage, ensuring each week-coffee combination is treated as a single time point for lag feature calculations.\n",

    "### ⚠️ CRITICAL FINDING: Data Structure Issue Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the diagnostic reveals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Expected structure**: 56 unique dates × 8 coffee types = 448 samples\n",
    "2. **Actual structure**: 641 samples (43% MORE than expected!)\n",
    "3. **The problem**: Some dates appear **11-13 times** instead of the expected 8 times\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this happens:**\n",
    "- The data preparation sorts by `['coffee_name', 'week_start_date']` \n",
    "- Lag features are calculated **within each coffee group**\n",
    "- BUT: Some weeks have **duplicate entries** for the same coffee (see rows 0-1, both Americano on 2024-02-26)\n",
    "- This creates an artificial data structure where:\n",
    "  - Row 0: Americano on 2024-02-26, prev_week_revenue = 0\n",
    "  - Row 1: Americano on 2024-02-26, prev_week_revenue = 115.60 (lag from row 0!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the model handles this:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is **NOT confused** by duplicate dates because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`coffee_encoded` feature differentiates between coffee types** (values 0-7)\n",
    "2. **Lag features are coffee-specific**, so:\n",
    "   - Americano's `prev_week_revenue` reflects Americano's history\n",
    "   - Latte's `prev_week_revenue` reflects Latte's history\n",
    "   - They're **independent time series** that happen to share calendar dates\n",
    "3. **Temporal features** (week_of_year, month) are the same across coffees for the same date\n",
    "4. The model learns: \"For coffee_encoded=0 (Americano) on week 10 with prev_revenue=X, predict Y\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**What makes this work:**\n",
    "- LightGBM can split on `coffee_encoded` early in the tree\n",
    "- Each coffee type has its own lag/rolling features reflecting its unique revenue pattern\n",
    "- The model essentially learns **8 different functions** (one per coffee) that share temporal patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**The duplicates within the same coffee are the real issue:**\n",
    "- Having multiple rows for the same coffee on the same date with different lag values is problematic\n",
    "- This suggests data quality issues in the source CSV (possibly multiple transactions aggregated incorrectly)\n",
    "- This needs investigation in `data_prep.ipynb`"

    "\n",
    "### The Good News: Coffee Type Separation Works Fine ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "The model **correctly** handles multiple coffee types with the same dates because:\n",
    "- **`coffee_encoded` (0-7) identifies each coffee type**\n",
    "- **Lag features are coffee-specific** (calculated within each coffee group)\n",
    "- LightGBM splits on `coffee_encoded` to learn separate patterns per coffee\n",

    "\n",
    "### The Bad News: Duplicate Rows Within Same Coffee-Date ❌\n",
    "\n",
    "**The REAL problem**: 43% data inflation due to duplicates within the same coffee-date combination!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Latte on 2024-12-30 appears **3 times** with cascading lag values:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Row 1: Latte 2024-12-30, revenue=143.04, prev_week_revenue=35.76\n",
    "Row 2: Latte 2024-12-30, revenue=71.52,  prev_week_revenue=143.04  ← Uses Row 1!\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**This means:**\n",
    "- 218 coffee-date combinations have duplicates (out of 421 total)\n",
    "- 220 excess rows artificially inflate the dataset\n",
    "- Lag features create **fake temporal sequences** within the same week\n",

    "\n",
    "### Root Cause 🔍\n",
    "\n",
    "This originates from **`data_prep.ipynb`** where weekly aggregation likely:\n",
    "1. Doesn't properly group by `['coffee_name', 'week_start_date']`\n",
    "2. Or has multiple transaction records that should be summed but are kept separate\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "**Option 1: Fix data_prep.ipynb** (Proper solution)\n",
    "- Ensure weekly aggregation uses `.groupby(['coffee_name', 'week_start_date']).sum()`\n",

    "\n",
    "**Option 2: Deduplicate here** (Quick fix)\n",
